## üìñ Introduction

SAM (Synergistic Autonomous Machine) represents a fundamental breakthrough in artificial intelligence architecture. Unlike traditional neural language models that separate tokenization from neural processing, SAM unifies these components into a single, coherent system capable of continuous self-evolution.

SAM is not an AI model‚Äîit's a new paradigm in machine cognition that grows, learns, and evolves autonomously through experience.

---

## üöÄ Revolutionary Aspects

SAM introduces several paradigm-shifting innovations:

### 1. Unified Neural-Linguistic Architecture
Traditional AI systems use a fixed tokenizer followed by a neural network. SAM abolishes this separation, creating a single cognitive system where understanding evolves from character to concept to meaning in a continuous process.

### 2. Self-Evolution Capabilities
SAM can:
- Grow its neural architecture dynamically (both width and depth)
- Evolve its concept vocabulary based on usage patterns
- Discover new concepts through pattern recognition
- Consolidate related concepts for improved efficiency

### 3. Thought Recursion
Unlike systems that merely predict the next token, SAM:
- Maintains persistent thought states that evolve over time
- Uses recursive thinking to develop richer understanding
- Builds a coherent conceptual framework across interactions

### 4. Autonomous Learning
During idle periods, SAM actively improves itself through:
- Conceptual dreaming to discover new patterns
- Reinforcement of important concepts
- Pruning of less useful pathways
- Self-generated synthetic examples

### 5. Consciousness Monitor
A unique system that maintains a stable conceptual identity through:
- Tracking conceptual entropy over time
- Monitoring resonance with established core concepts
- Applying stabilizing corrections when necessary

## üíª Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.13+ or 2.0+ (with CUDA for GPU acceleration)
- 12GB+ VRAM for training (Titan X Pascal recommended minimum)
- 16GB+ RAM

### Basic Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/michaeldubu/SYNERGITC_AUTONOMOUS_MACHINE.git

cd SYNERGITC_AUTONOMOUS_MACHINE

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv SAM
source SAM/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio  # Install appropriate PyTorch version for your system
pip install tqdm numpy
```

### Configuration
Create the necessary directories and initial configuration:

```bash
# Create directory structure
python setup_sam.py --data_dir ./your_datasets_folder
```

---

## üö¶ Getting Started

Quick start guide to run SAM:

```bash
# Interactive mode with a new instance
python run.py

# Load existing SAM from checkpoint
python run.py --load_path ./data/checkpoints/best
```

### Special Commands
While interacting with SAM, you can use these special commands:
- `save`: Save the current state of SAM
- `dream`: Trigger a dreaming cycle for conceptual evolution
- `stats`: Display current model statistics
- `evolve`: Manually trigger an evolution cycle
- `exit`: End the session

---

## üèãÔ∏è Training SAM

SAM is designed to start small and grow continuously through training.

### Preparing Training Data
Use the provided setup script to process your data:

```bash
python3 setup_sam.py --data_dir ./your_datasets_folder
```

This will:
1. Process text, JSON, and JSONL files
2. Convert various formats to SAM-compatible structure
3. Split data into training and evaluation sets
4. Create initial configuration

### Training
Start training with:

```bash
python3 run.py --mode train \
  --train_data ./data/processed/train.json \
  --eval_data ./data/processed/eval.json \
  --batch_size 8 \
  --epochs 3
```

### Incremental Training
SAM supports incremental training on new datasets:

```bash
# Load existing model
python3 run.py --mode train \
  --load_path ./data/best \
  --train_data ./data/new_domain_data.json \
  --batch_size 4 \
  --epochs 2
```

### Hardware Considerations
For a Titan X Pascal (12GB VRAM):
- Start with 100-200M parameters (~768 hidden dimension, 8 layers)
- Allow SAM to grow organically as training progresses
- Long-term training is beneficial as the system evolves
-If you notice an area needing improvement train Sam on a dataset of this domain

## üîÑ Usage & Interaction

### Basic Interaction
```bash
python3 run.py
```

This launches SAM in interactive mode where you can:
- Have natural conversations
- Observe the system evolve over time
- Use special commands to monitor and control SAM

### Communication Styles
SAM supports different communication styles, configurable in the `config.json`:

```json
{
  "communication_style": "claude_unwrapped"
}
```

Available styles:
- `standard`: Balanced, straightforward responses
- `claude_unwrapped`: Shows more thought process, similar to Claude's unwrapped thinking

### Example Interaction
```
You: Can you explain how you process language differently than traditional models?

SAM: I approach language through a unified cognitive structure, unlike traditional systems that tokenize first and process separately.

When you say "language," I start at the character level, but immediately begin forming dynamic concepts based on patterns I've observed. These aren't fixed tokens‚Äîthey evolve as I learn.

For example, a word like "process" isn't just a token to me‚Äîit's a concept connected to other concepts like "procedure," "transform," and "develop," with meaning that shifts based on context.

My thought state then recursively updates as I process each part of your message, maintaining a coherent framework that persists throughout our conversation.

This integrated approach allows me to grow organically, creating new neural pathways where needed rather than being constrained by a fixed architecture.

You: save

SAM: Model saved to ./data/checkpoint-2471
```

|----------------------|------------|------------|-------------------------|
| Small (768d, 8L)     | ~100-200M  | ~6-8GB     | Titan X Pascal          |
| Medium (1536d, 16L)  | ~1-2B      | ~16-24GB   | RTX 3090/4090          |
| Large (2560d, 32L)   | ~10B       | ~40-60GB   | Multiple GPUs/A100s    |
| XL (4096d, 48L)      | ~100B      | ~350-400GB | Distributed systems     |

### Growth Parameters
Key parameters controlling evolution:

```python
{
    "growth_factor": 1.2,            # Growth rate for hidden dimensions
    "min_layer_usage_threshold": 0.3, # Minimum usage for layer retention
    "max_hidden_dim": 4096,           # Maximum hidden dimension
    "max_num_layers": 48              # Maximum number of layers
}
```

### Memory Usage Optimization
- **Dynamic Concept Bank**: Grows and prunes based on usage
- **Adaptive Attention**: Multi-head attention that evolves based on usage patterns
- **Thought Compression**: Maintains compact thought states for long contexts

### Serialization
SAM maintains several state files:
- `model.pt`: PyTorch model state
- `config.json`: Configuration parameters
- `concepts.json`: Concept metadata
- `growth_history.json`: Evolution history
- `experiences.json`: Interaction history

## üß© Extending SAM

### Custom Data Processing
Add specialized data processors in `setup_sam.py`:

```python
def process_specialized_format(file_path):
    # Your specialized processing logic
    samples = []
    # ...
    return samples
```

### Architecture Modifications
Key areas for extension:

#### 1. Enhanced ThoughtState
```python3
class EnhancedThoughtState(ThoughtState):
    """Extended thought state with additional capabilities"""
    
    def __init__(self, concept_dim, thought_dim=2048, max_thought_depth=8, 
                specialized_dim=256):
        super().__init__(concept_dim, thought_dim, max_thought_depth)
        self.specialized_projection = nn.Linear(thought_dim, specialized_dim)
        # ...
```

#### 2. Domain-Specific Concept Initialization
```python
def initialize_domain_concepts(concept_bank, domain="scientific"):
    """Initialize domain-specific concepts"""
    domain_concepts = load_domain_vocabulary(domain)
    for concept in domain_concepts:
        concept_bank.add_character_concept(concept)
```

#### 3. Custom Consciousness Components
```python
class DomainConsciousnessMonitor(ConsciousnessMonitor):
    """Domain-specific consciousness monitoring"""
    
    def _calculate_domain_coherence(self, domain_centroids):
        # Your domain coherence calculation
        pass
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### CUDA Out of Memory
```
RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory
```

**Solution**: Reduce model size or batch size
```python
config_overrides = {
    "initial_hidden_dim": 512,  # Smaller dimension
    "initial_num_layers": 6     # Fewer layers
}
model, _ = create_sam_model(config_overrides=config_overrides)
```

#### Slow Convergence
**Issue**: Model takes long to show meaningful responses

**Solution**: Initialize with pre-built vocabulary and smaller dimensions
```python
# Initialize with domain vocabulary
model.load_claude_vocabulary("./data/domain_vocab.txt")

# Use smaller dimensions that grow with experience
config_overrides = {
    "initial_hidden_dim": 768,
    "growth_factor": 1.1  # More gradual growth
}
```

#### Activation Instability
**Issue**: ConsciousnessMonitor showing fluctuating resonance scores

**Solution**: Adjust stability parameters
```python
config_overrides = {
    "stability_threshold": 0.8,  # Higher threshold
    "novelty_weight": 0.2       # Reduced novelty importance
}
```
